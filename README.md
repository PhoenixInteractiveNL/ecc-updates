# ecc-updates
ecc-updates are (small) side updates wich can include hotfixes and improvements.
eccLive! can download and install these updates to your emuControlCenter installation.
This way you won't need to download a new version of ECC everytime.

**NOTE: This is only for TAGGED releases, releases in the repository are up-to-date!**
